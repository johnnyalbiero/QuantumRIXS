That's a repository to register the track of my studyes on Quantum Dynamics and Quantum Chemistry as a undergraduate student and hopefully as a graduate.

For now, and as initial step, I made a Split operator code that evolve temporaly wavefunction in a arbitrary potential (inspired by other codes that a I saw).

The idea is that using split operator and other methods, study the absorption and emission of eletrons in RIXS theory.
